# QLearning README

What is Q Learning? What does the Q stand for (and what about the "Learning")?
- QLearning is a reinforcement training algorithm. It is used to learn an highest or best policy for a Markov decision process.
- The Q is QLearning stands for quality. The quality of a particular action in a particular state. Learning refers to the process of learning the highest policy through trial and error.

What is RL (Reinforcement Learning) and how does it relate to ML (Machine Learning)?
- Reinforcement Learning falls under the larger Machine Learning branch. RL deals with training agents to make decisions in an environment by reinforced learning, or learning from past attempts. In RL, an agent will learn to interact with their envrionment & take the right actions to maximize "reward". RL does incorporate the Markov decision process to update the agent's policy until it reaches an optimal state. What's different about RL compared to supervised and unsurpervised learning is that it doesn't rely on previous knowledge or datasets.

What does it mean for Q Learning to be "model-free"?
- QLearning is considered to be a "model-free" training algorithm because of its ability to not rely on a model to reach an optimal decision making state. This RL algorithm instead learns directly from experience. 


What, if anything, is Q Learning often used for? (If you find any cool projects or research relating to Q Learning, feel free to link them to me!)
- QLearning is actually a very popular training algorithm. It can be implemented into Game Playing, Robotics(learn from tasks of not bumping into obstacles, learning how to hold objects, etc.), and even Autonomous Driving(learn to change lanes, merge onto a highway from previous experiences).
